# Golang Agents for the Internet Computer (IC)

This repository provides autogenerated agents for interacting with various canisters on the Internet Computer (IC).
These agents simplify the process of sending queries and updates to canisters using Golang.

## Configuration

[testdata/config.json](testdata/config.json).
